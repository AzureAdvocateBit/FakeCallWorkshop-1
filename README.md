# Chloe's Fake Call Workshop
Materials to build your own fake boyfriend/boss/sibling/co-worker call with Azure &amp; Twilio

Today we will build a fake calling app using
‚ö° [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/?WT.mc_id=github-workshop-chcondon)
‚òéÔ∏è [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
üîò and a [Flic button](http://flic.io/shop/flic-1pack?aff=10)

Before we begin, if you're looking for a quick summary and overview on Azure Functions, I reccomend [starting here with our documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=github-workshop-chcondon), or taking 4 minutes to read in more detail [how to create your first Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-chcondon), so you have some context on how to use functions within Azure.
