# Chloe's Fake Call Workshop
A workshop to build your own fake boyfriend/boss/sibling/co-worker call with Azure &amp; Twilio

Today we will build a fake calling app using:

+ ‚ö° [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/?WT.mc_id=github-workshop-chcondon)
+ ‚òéÔ∏è [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
+ üîòA [Flic button](http://flic.io/shop/flic-1pack?aff=10)
+ üì±Your cellphone 

Before we begin, if you're looking for a quick summary and overview on Azure Functions, I reccomend [starting here with our documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/?WT.mc_id=github-workshop-chcondon), or taking 4 minutes to read in more detail [how to create your first Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function?WT.mc_id=devto-blog-chcondon), so you have some context on how to use functions within Azure.

You can learn more about the original project [in my blog post](https://dev.to/azure/an-ambivert-s-guide-to-azure-functions-27b8)! And [the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ChloeCodesThings/sos-plz-save-me) is open, available, and interested in contributions!

Happy coding, friends!

## Let Us Begin!
Today we will build a fake calling app using Azure Functions, Twilio, and a Flic button. We will start by creating a Function App in Azure. Then we will create a Twilio account, create 2 Azure Functions, and test it out on our phones.

Here's a diagram of what we'll be doing:
